INSTRUCTIONS

The goal is to either remove all enemy pawns or find the chest with gold! This game is meant to be played with two players on one screen.

Left-Click to chose a pawn and tile to move to. 
Right-Click and drag (or WASD keys) to move the camera.

When you start, you have to place three pawns on the first row of the board and then click the 'OK' button in the top right corner. This will start the game.

You can only move forwards and one big step backwards. 
To attack an enemy's pawn or open a chest, you have to strike backwards.
